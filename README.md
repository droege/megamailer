# Megamailer
Megamailer is a very simple thing: Give it some CSV and an email template and it will bombard your default email app with the generated drafts. In your email app, you will have to click "send" for each message manually.

It is therefore not very useful for really big email campaigns. But for smaller sizes, it should work fine and it allows you to check each email separately.
